# The 3Pm model is one of the four published Nitrogen Removal Models (NRM Models) that simulates nitrogen removal and biochemical transformations in bioretention systems. 
# the NRM models were designed to take time series of hydraulic processes and inflow concentrations from SWMM simulation, and simulate time seriese (or event mean values) of nitrogen removal. It also simulate time series  (and event mean values) of nitrogne content in the pounding layer, user-defined soil layers, and the storage layer of a bioretention system.
# one of the primary advantages of NRM models is that it simulates the impacts of temprature, soil moisture content, and organic matter content on nitrogen removal and transformation.
# the NRM models can be used for: a) engineering design of bioretention systems, estimating nitrogen removal rates of different parameter designs; b) optimizing real time control strategies that aims to prevent flooding, reuse stormwater, or balance between these two competing targets.

# the Three-Pool-Michaelis Menton Model (the 3Pm model) is a version of NRM that simulates three nitrogen pools (NH4, NO3, ON) and the biochemical reactions that converts nitrogen among the three pools. the simulated biochemical processes include: decomposition, nitrification, denitrification, and assimilation by plants and microbes. Michelis -Menton equation is used to simualte biochemical reaction rates.
